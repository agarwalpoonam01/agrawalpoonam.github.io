## Understanding CPU load Average On the basis of following variables:
#### - CPU cores.
#### - CPU load average.
#### - CPU load average on the basis of number of CPU.

### CPU Cores
- We can check the number of cpu cores by one of the following commands:
$ nproc
4

OR
lscpu

$ grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l

4

### CPU load average 
- We can check load on the cpu with the following commands:
$ cat /proc/loadavg

2.48 1.69 1.42 5/889 10570
 
$ cat /proc/loadavg

2.48 1.69 1.42 5/889 10570

### CPU load average on the basis of number of CPU
Letâ€™s say we have load averages below:

23:16:49 up  10:49,  5 user,  load average: 1.00, 0.40, 3.35

### On a single core system this would mean:
- The CPU was fully (100%) utilized on average; 1 processes was running on the CPU (1.00) over the last 1 minute.

- The CPU was idle by 60% on average; no processes were waiting for CPU time (0.40) over the last 5 minutes.

- The CPU was overloaded by 235% on average; 2.35 processes were waiting for CPU time (3.35) over the last 15 minutes.

### On a dual-core system this would mean:
- The one CPU was 100% idle on average, one CPU was being used; no processes were waiting for CPU time(1.00) over the last 1 minute.

- The CPUs were idle by 160% on average; no processes were waiting for CPU time. (0.40) over the last 5 minutes.

- The CPUs were overloaded by 135% on average; 1.35 processes were waiting for CPU time. (3.35) over the last 15 minutes.
